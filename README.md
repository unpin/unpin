## Hi there 👋

My name is __German__, I’m a web developer with a strong passion for building modern applications across both frontend and backend. I’m currently seeking an entry-level position or internship where I can expand my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and grow within a collaborative team.

I enjoy working with technologies such as TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Deno, Fresh, MongoDB, and SQL. I also dabble in Swift and SwiftUI.
